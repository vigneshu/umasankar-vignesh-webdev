                Around 50,000 residents of Zambia’s Western province were without electricity on Sunday, after a baboon wandered into a power station and
                fiddled with the equipment. Incredibly, the baboon managed to survive the incident. As Africa News reports, the blackout affected homes and
                businesses in Livingstone, a popular tourist town near Victoria Falls, and the surrounding area. The baboon likely wandered in from a nearby national park,
                and its curiosity likely led it to the strange, high voltage machines. “The baboon tampered with the A station and the B3 and B5 machines in our power
                station cutting electricity to Western Province and of course Livingstone town so we have about 28,000 customers in Livingstone and 22,000 customers in
                Western Province. So the baboon cut our power station around 06:50 hours,” Henry Kapata, a spokesperson for the state-run power company ZESCO, told a
                local radio station, according to Africa News. “The lines the baboon was tampering with are extremely high voltage. You can see that it was electrocuted
                in so many ways but it has survived. It is an animal, we cannot prosecute it otherwise if it was a human we would have taken it to court.”

                Two demos from today’s keynote stood out, both for being entertaining and for revealing a potentially frightening future for anyone working for a big employer with the will to micro-monitor its employees.
                It is also, you know, terrifying. Microsoft’s demo purposely focused on a construction worksite, where accidents are too common, and a smart AI overseer sort of makes sense. Spotting OSHA violations or trespassers quickly and then relaying that information to an employer via mobile notifications could genuinely save limbs and lives.

                But my brain immediately started conjuring a scenario that was much more oppressive—One where these cameras were in some open office where people come to work in skirts or button downs from Dillard’s. Not a place where security or safety is a primary concern, but instead, a place where employers obsessively monitor employees in some misguided attempt to maximize profit by chewing up and spitting out the fleshy cogs in their machine.

                With a surveillance system like this you couldn’t invite your friend to stop by for lunch because your boss would know, a notification instantly appearing on their phone. There’d be no long lunches or grabbing extra office supplies from the closet. Take a too smoke breaks or have a bout of indigestion that leaves you on the toilet longer than usual? The AI would be able to notice so quickly that your boss could meet you in the hallway with a bottle of Pepto Bismol.
